Said tacos usually take hours or more to prepare, leaving us too drained to partake in our beloved Taco Tuesdays.\n Thankfully, he found a way to incorporate some fresh Mexican flavors into a 20- minute chicken taco so we can enjoy our favorite tortilla- wrapped cuisine any night of the week!',

The first time around, caught up in our time- crunched, health- conscious minds, they weren\'t as exciting as the usual meaty tacos we\'re accustomed to.\nI had the idea to, "Dress up," the tacos in some fabulous (and healthy) toppings. One Taco Tuesday later and we were in business! Fresh pico de gallo, creamy avocado, salsa verde, and yep- even a bit of cheese made these almost- diet tacos worthy of our pallets.',
