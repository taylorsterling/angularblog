        intro1_title: 'An Easy Take on an All- Time Favorite',
        intro1_body: 'My husband, who grew up in Mexico, always knows how to make the best tacos- delicious tacos with marinated meats, fresh produce, and homemade tortillas. Said tacos usually take hours or more to prepare, leaving us too drained to partake in our beloved Taco Tuesdays.\n Thankfully, he found a way to incorporate some fresh Mexican flavors into a 20- minute chicken taco so we can enjoy our favorite tortilla- wrapped cuisine any night of the week!',
        intro1_image: 'assets/media/tacochicken.jpg',
        intro2_title: 'The Breakthrough',
        intro2_body: 'Inspired by our attempts to get healthier, one night he substituted our typical taco beef with some pan- seared chicken. The first time around, caught up in our time- crunched, health- conscious minds, they weren\'t as exciting as the usual meaty tacos we\'re accustomed to.\nI had the idea to, "Dress up," the tacos in some fabulous (and healthy) toppings. One Taco Tuesday later and we were in business! Fresh pico de gallo, creamy avocado, salsa verde, and yep- even a bit of cheese made these almost- diet tacos worthy of our pallets.',

        yield: '4 tacos',
        ingredients: [
          '4 boneless skinless chicken breast tenders',
          'Salt and pepper to taste',
          '2 TBSP vegetable oil (separated in half)',
          '1 TBSP creole seasoning (Our favorite is Tony\'s)',
          '4 White corn tortillas (Our go to: Guerrero\'s)',
          'Optional:',
          '1 Sliced avocado',
          '4oz Pico de gallo',
          '1 pinch Cojita cheese (per taco)',
          'Drizzle of salsa verde (per taco) Check out our fave: Herdez',

        instructions: [
          'Grab a good size non- stick pan, drizzle with one portion of oil, and put it on the stove over med-low heat.',
          'My husband has cooked the chicken two different ways. You can either cut the chicken into bite- sized pieces, or using a knife you can carefully slice each tender vertically down the middle, about halfway through the breast, and cook them whole. Prepare your chicken accordingly.',
          'Sprinkle the chicken with the creole seasoning and place in the pan',
          'If you broke up the chicken, cook while stirring occasionally. If you cook the tenders whole, flip them once or twice until they have a golden- brown color, and keep the pan covered.',
          'Just before the chicken is done, heat up a comal (or another large pan), and drizzle with the remaining oil and set over medium heat.',
          'While the chicken finishes cooking, place the tortillas in the comal/pan and cook on both sides until they obtain a slightly golden color.',
          'Place fried tortillas on a plate- just watch out as they\'ll be hot!',
          'Spread around chicken evenly if cooked in pieces, or place 1 tender in the center of each taco.',
          'Prepare your toppings and add as much as you like!'

        intro1_body: 'This recipe started out in college, when it was cheap to buy pasta, chicken, and add some heavy cream and parmesan. For years since then,\n I\'ve been working to perfect it, and at last I believe my recipe is ready to share with the world! \n Creamy, cheesy, and oh so comforting, this recipe is NOT okay for you to make if you\'re trying to eat healthy. The only \n healthy thing about it is the broccoli I add... but it is SO worth it on a cheat day!',

        intro2_title: 'Not Your Average Alfredo',
        intro2_body: 'I\'m sure you\'ve seen plenty of Alfredo recipes. There are Southern versions that start with a roux, some that use heavy cream, and \n even some that use cream cheese. Well, my recipe incorporates a lot of ingredients, and some may not even seem like a traditional, "Alfredo". Perhaps not \n, but if it\'s not delicious I don\'t know what is. Overall, this recipe is pretty easy to make. It\'s best served with cheesy garlic bread, so I strongly suggest having some \n on hand before cooking!',

        instructions: [
          'Fill a pot about ¾ of the way with water and put on the stove. Add salt and olive oil, then crank that heat up high so it comes to a boil.',
          'Drizzle olive oil for the chicken into a big, non-stick pan. Turn burner on medium heat.',
          'Carefully cut chicken into bite- sized pieces (or larger, if you prefer). Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and lemon pepper. Transfer to pan, and let it cook for about 3-4 minutes until the bottoms of the chicken start to turn golden- brown.',
          'Once the water is boiling, gently add the fettuccine to the pot, and cook according to instructions (or to texture preference). When the noodles are flexible but still have a lot of bite to them, add the frozen broccoli directly into the pot with the pasta.',
          'Sprinkle paprika and italian seasoning in the pan once you see some juice expelled from the chicken. Continue to cook on medium heat, covered and stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked all the way through. If the chicken starts to cook through too fast before the pasta is ready, lower the heat to a light simmer and uncover.',
          'To start the sauce, grab a sauce pan or small pot and put it on med heat over the stove. Drizzle in the olive oil, and add the white wine until it reduces to about ½.',
          'Add the garlic to the sauce, constantly stirring until fragrant- this should only take about 10 seconds or so. Pour in the heavy cream, then season with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to med-high, and let the cream come to a gentle boil.',
          'Once the cream is bubbling, add the cheese in small increments until you reach your desired sauce consistency, stirring steadily. Add in the Italian seasoning, and squeeze the lemon juice into the sauce, stirring and tasting until the acidity from the lemon is able to subtly cut through the richness of the sauce.',
          'When the pasta is cooked to your liking, very carefully strain it to dump out all the water. Return the pasta to the pot, and add the cooked chicken - including its juices. Carefully pour in the sauce, and stir it well to mix the pasta, broccoli, and chicken together evenly.',
          'Optional: Pour the Alfredo into a serving dish and sprinkle with fresh parmesan and parsley to garnish. Don’t forget to serve it with some garlic bread!'

  intro1_body: 'I\'ve had this one since high school! After baking cookies in HomeEc, I decided to adapt a few recipes we had to create the PERFECT peanut butter cookie recipe! I chose these cookies to be my first official dessert recipe because of my childhood memories of them. Every Christmas, no matter which side of my family I was with, we\'d have a big platter of cookies, and these ones with the Hershey Kisses were always my go- to!',
  intro1_image: 'assets/media/pbcookies2.jpg',
  intro2_title: 'So Good Year Round',
  intro2_body: 'Despite being my favorite holiday cookie, these are delicious no matter what time of year you bake them! Admittedly I\m not even a huge fan of peanut butter, but I can never eat just one of these! Give them a try and enjoy some yourself!',
  intro2_image: 'assets/media/pbcookies.jpg',
  prep_time: "25- 30 minutes",
  yield: '~25 cookies',
  ingredients: [
    '1/2 cup salted butter',
    '1/2 cup peanut butter',
    '1 cup sugar (separated in half)',
    '1/2 cup brown sugar',
    '1 egg',
    '2 tbsp milk',
    '1 tsp vanilla',
    '1 3/4 cup flour',
    '1 tsp baking soda',
    '1/2 tsp salt',
    'Optional: 1 bag (~25) Hershey Kisses'


  ],

  instructions: [
    'Preheat oven to 375 F, cream (easiest to use a handmixer) butter and 1/2 cup sugar together.',
    'Add peanut butter and brown sugar, mix.',
    'Beat egg and pour it in along with vanilla and milk.',
    'Mix dry ingredients together (flour, baking soda, and salt), and add to wet ingredients 1/3 at a time using the hand mixer.',
    'Pour remaining 1/2 cup sugar on a plate. Form the dough into spheres, about 1 inch in size. Once formed, roll each cookie in the sugar and place on a greased cookie sheet.',
    'Once all the cookie spheres are evenly spread out (not touching each other) on the cookie sheet, use a fork and gently press down on the tops of the spheres in perpendicular directions (this creates the "criss cross" effect on the cookies, as well as slightly flattens them to the right shape).',
    'Bake 8-12 minutes, carefully checking until they get lightly golden brown on top. Be careful not to overcook, unless you prefer a crunchier cookie. While they bake, unwrap Hershey Kisses if desired.',
    'When the cookies are done baking, place them on a cooling rack. Wait about 2-3 minutes for them to cool down a bit, then gently press down the Hershey Kisses on the tops so the bottoms can slightly melt into the cookie',
    'Grab a glass of milk and enjoy!'
