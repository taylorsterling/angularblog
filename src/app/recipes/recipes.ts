        intro1_body: 'My husband, who grew up in Mexico, always knows how to make the best tacos- delicious tacos with marinated meats, fresh produce, and homemade tortillas. Said tacos usually take hours or more to prepare, leaving us too drained to partake in our beloved Taco Tuesdays.\n Thankfully, he found a way to incorporate some fresh Mexican flavors into a 20- minute chicken taco so we can enjoy our favorite tortilla- wrapped cuisine any night of the week!',

        intro2_title: 'The Breakthrough',
        intro2_body: 'Inspired by our attempts to get healthier, one night he substituted our typical taco beef with some pan- seared chicken. The first time around, caught up in our time- crunched, health- conscious minds, they weren\'t as exciting as the usual meaty tacos we\'re accustomed to.\nI had the idea to, "Dress up," the tacos in some fabulous (and healthy) toppings. One Taco Tuesday later and we were in business! Fresh pico de gallo, creamy avocado, salsa verde, and yep- even a bit of cheese made these almost- diet tacos worthy of our pallets.',

          'My husband has cooked the chicken two different ways. You can either cut the chicken into bite- sized pieces, or using a knife you can carefully slice each tender vertically down the middle, about halfway through the breast, and cook them whole. Prepare your chicken accordingly.',
          'Sprinkle the chicken with the creole seasoning and place in the pan',
          'If you broke up the chicken, cook while stirring occasionally. If you cook the tenders whole, flip them once or twice until they have a golden- brown color, and keep the pan covered.',

For years since then,\n I\'ve been working to perfect it, and at last I believe my recipe is ready to share with the world! \n Creamy, cheesy, and oh so comforting, this recipe is NOT okay for you to make if you\'re trying to eat healthy. The only \n healthy thing about it is the broccoli I add... but it is SO worth it on a cheat day!',

Well, my recipe incorporates a lot of ingredients, and some may not even seem like a traditional, "Alfredo". Perhaps not \n, but if it\'s not delicious I don\'t know what is. Overall, this recipe is pretty easy to make. It\'s best served with cheesy garlic bread, so I strongly suggest having some \n on hand before cooking!',

Continue to cook on medium heat, covered and stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked all the way through.

          'Once the cream is bubbling, add the cheese in small increments until you reach your desired sauce consistency, stirring steadily. Add in the Italian seasoning, and squeeze the lemon juice into the sauce, stirring and tasting until the acidity from the lemon is able to subtly cut through the richness of the sauce.',
          'When the pasta is cooked to your liking, very carefully strain it to dump out all the water. Return the pasta to the pot, and add the cooked chicken - including its juices. Carefully pour in the sauce, and stir it well to mix the pasta, broccoli, and chicken together evenly.',

I chose these cookies to be my first official dessert recipe because of my childhood memories of them. Every Christmas, no matter which side of my family I was with, we\'d have a big platter of cookies, and these ones with the Hershey Kisses were always my go- to!',
