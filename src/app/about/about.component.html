            <p>I was born and raised in Syracuse, NY (GO ORANGE!), and have since moved down to Texas. Growing up I've always been a gamer, ever since I was old enough to hold a PS1 controller. I grew up with divorced parents (as an only child for a few years), and had 2 gaming consoles at each house. At my Mom's I had a PS1, and there was an N64 at my Dad's. My first two games I ever played were Spyro the Dragon, and Donkey Kong 64 when I got the special edition DK N64 for my 6th birthday. Oh, memories.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">Growing up, I was fortunate enough to live in a city with some of the best food on Earth. I had it all; from the world- famous Dinosaur BBQ and Tully's Tenders, to my Dad's own BBQ, and of course my Grandmother's own meatballs. I never really learned how to cook until I was older (as I was and still am a very clumsy chef), so my passion for cooking didn't really develop until I was in college and had to officially learn to be a grown up. Although, I did once try to cook on my own when I was about 12. My dad was away, but once showed me how he made cheeseburgers. Hungry and eager to make one myself, I decided to give it a shot. I formed the patty just fine, and stuck it on what I now know is called a comal. Everything went great until it was time for the cheese. I put a slice of American on there and sat back wondering how I was supposed to make it melt. Being too impatient to figure it out, I decided to flip the burger- yes- with the cheese on it, and I let that cook for a while. Needless to say, the pan was destroyed, and I was left without a lunch. </p>

            <p>After high school, I decided it was time for a change- a fresh start. My Mom and Step Dad had moved down already and told me I should join them. Hating weather above 65 degrees, I immediately declined their invitation. I started college up North, but it just didn't feel right. I needed to make new friends and go on an adventure. After some reassurance from my Mom that Texas does in fact have air conditioning, I decided to give it a try. </p>
            <p class="mb-0">About 2 days after the 30 hour drive down, I realized this was not a good fit for me. No. Nope. 103 degrees. Get out. I begged my Mom to help me move back up north, but she told me to stay and give things a chance. I reluctantly agreed, but my mind never really changed. I was ready to peace out until AT LAST I met a new friend. She and I hit it off immediately and ended up like sisters. Before long, she invited me over to her house for dinner. Being honest now, she literally was the very first Hispanic person I had ever met, so I was a little nervous going to her house where her family only spoke Spanish.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">When I got there, I couldn't believe I was ever nervous. Even though her parents spoke a completely different language, they couldn't have made me feel more welcome. Her mom made us a delicious dinner and we all sat down and chatted (with translations of course). Her mom after a while said something that made my friend laugh. She said that her mom thought that I would make a good match for her brother. We laughed and I didn't think much of it. Little did I know, that was the first time I heard someone mention the man who would later become my husband!</p>
